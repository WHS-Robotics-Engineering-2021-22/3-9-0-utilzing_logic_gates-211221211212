#1 In The NAND gate is see if one gate is open or both and if they are it turns on the light.

#2 I built a XOR gate it see if swicth is close it will it will turn on the light. It wont turn on if both are open 
or close.

#3 I built an AND gate and on turn the light in if the both swicths are closed.
